## Geo Location Project
### Overview:
This project focuses on determining the geographic location based on postal and zip codes. The primary objectives include plotting these locations on a map and calculating the distance between points.

### Features:
#### Geocoding:

Utilizes postal and zip codes to retrieve corresponding geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude).
#### Mapping:

Plots the obtained coordinates on a map for visual representation.
#### Distance Calculation:

Determines the distance between the plotted points using geodesic distance calculations.
### Why:
Spatial Analysis:

Enables spatial analysis and visualization, aiding in better understanding of geographical distribution.
#### Logistics and Planning:

Useful for logistics and planning, especially when dealing with multiple locations.
#### Data Insight:

Provides insights into the distances between different areas, facilitating data-driven decision-making.
### Technologies Used:
#### Programming Language:

Implemented in Python.
#### Libraries:

Leverages geopy for geocoding and distance calculations.
#### Mapping:

Utilizes mapping libraries to visually represent geographic points.
### Usage:
#### Input:

Provide postal or zip codes as input.
#### Output:

Obtain mapped locations and distance information.
